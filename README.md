Django is a free, open source web framework written in the Python programming language and used by millions of programmers every year. Its popularity is due to its friendliness to both beginners and advanced programmers: Django is robust enough to be used by the largest websites in the world–Instagram, Pinterest, Bitbucket, but also flexible enough to be a good choice for early-stage startups and prototyping personal projects.
A web framework is a collection of modular tools that abstracts away much of the difficulty–and repetition–inherent in web development. For example, most websites need the same basic functionality: the ability to connect to a database, set URL routes, display content on a page, handle security properly, and so on. Rather than recreate all of this from scratch, programmers over the years have created web frameworks in all the major programming languages: Django and Flask in Python, Rails in Ruby, and Express in JavaScript among many, many others.
